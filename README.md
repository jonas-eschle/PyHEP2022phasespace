## Abstract
PhaseSpace is a Python package used for simulations of n-body decays and uses TensorFlow as the computational backend.

During this lightning talk, I will present a new feature in PhaseSpace: importing and simulating decays created using DecayLanguage, a package used for describing decays of particles. This improvement makes it possible to simulate complex decays in PhaseSpace while simultaneously improving the interface between various packages in the Scikit-HEP and zfit ecosystem.

A brief overview of PhaseSpace and DecayLanguage will be given, as well as a demonstration of the new feature and the customizations that are available.
